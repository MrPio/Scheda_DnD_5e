## How to add support to localization

Localization (l10n) and Internationalization (i18n) are handled by `flutter_localizations` and `intl` official flutter packages.
Configure the project like in https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility-and-internationalization/internationalization.

To add a localized string, add it to all the `.arb` files inside the `lib\l10n` directory, and reference it using `AppLocalizations.of(context)!.<FIELD_NAME>` from code.

Override the system locale using the `Localizations.override` widget.

## How to add a custom annotation with code generation

We'll use the `build_runner` dart package to do so.

1. In `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  source_gen: ^2.0.0

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^2.4.7
  build: ^2.4.2
  analyzer: ^7.1.0
```

2. Add the annotation class and the code generator class, just like I did in this project, in the
   `annotation/` folder. Make sure to add the builder method in the generator file.
3. Add a `build.yaml` file in the project root and register the newly created generator:

```yaml
builders:
  scheda_dnd_5e|localized:
    import: "package:scheda_dnd_5e/annotation/generator/localized_generator.dart"
    builder_factories: [ "localizedGenerator" ]
    build_extensions: { ".dart": [ ".g.dart" ] }
    auto_apply: dependents
    build_to: source

targets:
  $default:
    builders:
      scheda_dnd_5e|localized:
        generate_for:
          - lib/**/*.dart
```

4. Use `dart run build_runner build` to run the generator. This will create a `.g.part` file. Change
   the extension to `.dart` to highlight any syntax error.

Note: **this approach uses the extension functions mechanism**, so you need to import the generated
file where you need to access it. Another way to go is to use the `part/part-of` dart mechanism.

## Emulator is unbearably glitchy

### Problem

When GPU is in use (`host` mode) the emulator is faster, but more glitchy, the app crashes often and
screen sometimes freezes, preventing alert dialogs from showing.

### Solution

`Device Manager` --> `3 dots` --> `Show on Disk` --> open `config.ini` --> edit `hw.gpu.mode` from
`host` to `guest` to disable GPU optimization --> `Stop` and run device with `Cold boot`.

As it's always the case, CPU is slower but safer when it comes to emulation.

## Undo Github commits

### Problem

Sometimes you need to remove the latest commits from Github. This happens, for example, in the case
of a large `merge` operation caused by a forgotten `fetch' before committed changes.

### Solution

From the terminal, launch the following commands:

1. `git reset --soft <COMMIT_HASH>` where `COMMIT_HASH` is the SHA of the commit you can retrieve
   from Github or through the `git rev-list HEAD` command.
    * `--soft` is used to move the `HEAD` position updating the *index*, but not the *working tree*,
      i.e. the local files.
    * `--hard` is used to move the `HEAD` position updating the *index* and the *working tree*.
2. `git add .` & `git commit -m <MSG>` to commit the *working tree*.
3. `git push origin <BRANCH> --force` to overwrite all the commits happened after the `COMMIT_HASH`.

## Git mismatching line ending causes huge commits

### Problem

When committing from Linux, git forced me to rewrite all the files in the project, even those
without any changes by my side.

### Solution

This is due to the value of the `core.autocrlf` git variable, which may be different between my
Windows and Linux installations. This cause git to overwrite the LF with CRLF.
The solution is to write `* text=auto` in the `.gitattributes` file in the root of the project.

## View components taxonomy

- `page`: A widget wrapped with a `Material`. Note that `Scaffold` implicitly defines it.
- `screen`: A collection of widgets defining the content of a page or a portion of it. Does not
  define a parent `Material`, thus, must be inside a page.
- `partial`: A customizable widget or layout that is reused throughout the application. Specialize
  Flutter's built-in components to the needs of the application. **Minimize the client's freedom**
  in the parameters.

## Pass arguments to a page

### Problem

When calling a polymorphous page, how should I pass my arguments?

### Solution

I can come up with two strategies. In both case it's best to wrap our arguments in a dedicate class.

#### Navigator's arguments

As in [Flutter Doc](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/navigation/navigate-with-arguments), one way
is to rely on `Navigator`'s raw form of dependency injection.

```dart

ValueNotifier<Args?> args = ValueNotifier(null);

// build()
args.value ??= (
ModalRoute.of(context)!.settings.arguments) as Args?;

// initState()
args.addListener(() {
// Required to ensure that the widgets are built (may not be needed)
WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {
// Any initialization that needs to know the value of the args
});
});
```

The advantage is a **loosely coupled** binding between the caller and the page.

Note: if you split the polymorphous widget into page + screen, the page receives the args from the
Navigator and passes them to the screen constructor. This way the ValueNotifier<> wrapper can be
removed and the screen code becomes:

```dart
final Args? args;

// initState()
WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback
(
(_) {
// Any initialization that needs to know the value of the args
});
```

#### Using the constructor

This approach **ties** the navigation logic with the page's constructor. It should be used only on
`partial`s and `screen`s.

## Java and Gradle Compatibility

### Problem

Application fails to launch due to incompatibility between Java and Gradle version.

### Solution

1) Check versions according
   to [Compatibility Matrix](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html#javam)
    * Determine Gradle version by checking the distributionUrl in the
      *android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties* file.
    * Verify Java version by running *java -version* in terminal.
2) If Java version is incompatible, change it with:

```shell
flutter config --jdk-dir <path_to_jdk>
```

3) Recreate Project (if Gradle and Java versions are compatible)
    * Delete the android folder.
    * Recreate the project using:

```shell
flutter create --project-name scheda_dnd_5e .
```

Note: JDK version is your degree of freedom, flutter manages its own version of Gradle.

## Use `[]` initialization when the list is involved in a generic usage

When working with generics, it may become tricky to handle the assignment to lists.

### Problem

```dart

List<Character>? cachedCharacters = null;
List<Enchantment>? cachedEnchantments = null;

Map<core.Type, List<WithUID>> get caches =>
    {
      Character: cachedCharacters,
      Enchantment: cachedEnchantments,
    };
```

In this scenario, assigning the empty list is no easy task if we access the variable
through `caches`, where the supertype is `WithUID`.
This is because, in an instruction like `cache[Chracter]! = []` we try to assign `List<WithUID>`
to `List<Chracter>`.

### Solution

```dart

List<InventoryItem> cachedInventoryItems = [];
```
