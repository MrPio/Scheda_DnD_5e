# BACKLOG
- Character avatar image can be uploaded from the gallery

# TODO
- `MaxHP`:
  X Set MaxHP right after the character's creation
  - Update MaxHP after the new level
- `Inventory`:
  - edit custom item bottom sheet entry
  - In inventory, non satisfied strength requirement should be handled graphically
- `Mantainability`:
  - In numeric input, accorpa anche i pulsanti +, - laterali, cos√¨ pulisci un sacco di codice
  - Pages that are both screens and pages require cleaner code.
    - Define 1 screen (with args in constructor) and 1 page (with Navigator args) separately.
    - The page returns the screen wrapped in a Scaffold
    - The header title should be centralized since it's a lot of code and is common between Dice, Enchantments and User

# DONE
X Inventory TAB mockup
X Add custom inventory item page
