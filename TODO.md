# BACKLOG
- Character avatar image can be uploaded from the gallery

# TODO
- `MaxHP`:
  X Set MaxHP right after the character's creation
  - Update MaxHP after the new level
- `Inventory`:
  - edit custom item bottom sheet entry
  - Make sell in a separate page. Too many coins.
  - In inventory, non satisfied strength requirement should be handled graphically

# DONE
X `Mantainability`:
  X In numeric input, accorpa anche i pulsanti +, - laterali, cos√¨ pulisci un sacco di codice
  X Pages that are both screens and pages require cleaner code.
    X- Define 1 screen (with args in constructor) and 1 page (with Navigator args) separately.
    X The page returns the screen wrapped in a Scaffold
    X The header title should be centralized since it's a lot of code and is common between Dice, Enchantments and User
X Add custom inventory item page
X Inventory TAB mockup
